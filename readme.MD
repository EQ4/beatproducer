## About

A (experimental) beat producer environment based on the web audio API.  

## Browser Support
Except Microsoft Internet Explorer [the most major browsers](http://caniuse.com/#search=Web%20Audio%20API) will be supported. Currently development is in progress so in fact it is for shure runnin in Goolge Chrome for now. So far Chrome has many features build in as native functionality so you will indeed get the most perfomance with this browser!
